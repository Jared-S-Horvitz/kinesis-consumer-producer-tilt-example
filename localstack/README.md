# Localstack Docker Compose Setup

If you're on Mac, you'll need to allow Docker to have access to the `/var/folders` directory.  You can find that by 
going to Preferences > Resources > File Sharding, clicking on `/path/to/exported/directory`, entering `/var/folders` and 
clicking `Apply & Restart`.
